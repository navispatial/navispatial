## Geospatial tools for Dart

‚ú® (2024-04-22) [Decode and encode GeoJSON, WKT and WKB in Dart and Flutter apps](https://medium.com/@navibyte/decode-and-encode-geojson-wkt-and-wkb-in-dart-and-flutter-apps-ab2ef4ece2f1)

üß≠ The [geospatial](https://github.com/navibyte/geospatial) code repository with
geospatial data structures, tools and utilities for [Dart](https://dart.dev/)
and [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) - coordinates,
geometries, feature objects, metadata, spherical geodesy, projections, tiling
schemes, vector data models and formats, and geospatial Web APIs.

üì¶ The code packages published at
[pub.dev](https://pub.dev/publishers/navibyte.com/packages):

Code           | Package | Description 
-------------- | --------| -----------
:globe_with_meridians: [geobase](https://github.com/navibyte/geospatial/tree/main/dart/geobase) | [![pub package](https://img.shields.io/pub/v/geobase.svg)](https://pub.dev/packages/geobase) | Geospatial data structures (coordinates, geometries, features, metadata), spherical geodesy, projections and tiling schemes. Vector data format support for [GeoJSON](https://geojson.org/), [WKT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-known_text_representation_of_geometry) and [WKB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-known_text_representation_of_geometry#Well-known_binary).
:earth_americas: [geodata](https://github.com/navibyte/geospatial/tree/main/dart/geodata) | [![pub package](https://img.shields.io/pub/v/geodata.svg)](https://pub.dev/packages/geodata) | Geospatial feature service Web APIs with support for [GeoJSON](https://geojson.org/) and [OGC API Features](https://ogcapi.ogc.org/features/) clients.

üß© See [milestones](https://github.com/navibyte/geospatial/milestones) and [open issues](https://github.com/navibyte/geospatial/issues) for planned features, requests for change, and observed bugs. 

## Geospatial demos for Dart

‚ú® See also the
[Geospatial demos for Dart](https://github.com/navibyte/geospatial_demos) code
repository for demo and sample apps demonstrating the usage of
[geobase](https://pub.dev/packages/geobase) and
[geodata](https://pub.dev/packages/geodata) along with other topics.

Code          | Description 
------------- | -----------
[earthquake_map](https://github.com/navibyte/geospatial_demos/tree/main/earthquake_map) | Shows earthquakes fetched from the [USGS web service](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/) on a basic map view. The demo uses both [geobase](https://pub.dev/packages/geobase) and [geodata](https://pub.dev/packages/geodata) packages for geospatial data accesss. Discusses also state management based on [Riverpod](https://riverpod.dev/). The map UI is based on the [Google Maps Flutter](https://pub.dev/packages/google_maps_flutter) plugin.

üìÖ The first version of this repository was published in August 2022, updated
October 2023.

## Older samples and demos
